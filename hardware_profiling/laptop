`/sys/devices/system/cpu/...`)

CPU:
	Manufacturer: Intel
	Model: Core 2 Duo P8600
	u-Architecture: Penryn-3M, 45nm, medium voltage
	Clock: 2.4GHz
	FSB: 1066MHz (Main Memory only runs at 800MHz (1.2ns) )
	chip reference
	cores: 2
	peak FP performance
		Theoretical: each core has 2 FP units, each can issue a new SIMD
					instruction per clock cycle. each SIMD instruction can
					carry 2 double precision floating point numbers, for a
					total of 4 flops per cycle, for each core
		
					peak FP = #cores * flops/cycle * frequency
							= 2		 * 4		   * 2.4*10^9
							= 19 GFLOPS

Cache details:
	L1: One per core
		32KB data / 32KB instructions
		Synchronous
		8-way Set-associative (64 sets, 8 lines each)
		Line Size: 64B
		synchronous internal write-back
	L2: Shared
		3MB
		12-way Set-associative (4096 sets, 12 lines each)
		Line Size: 64B
		synchronous write-back unified
		Error Correction Type: Single-bit ECC
	L3: N/A

Main Memory:
	Bandwidth of memory access from the higher cache level on chip:
		Theoretical: DDR2-800 / PC6400 -> 6.4GB/s
			64 bit bus + 800MHz (400MHz real, double data rate) = 6.4GB/s
			Dual Channel:
				6.4 * 2 = 12.8 GB/s
	Latency:
			Later benchmark: 85-95 nscannot open file hpccinf.txt
	Size: 4096MB

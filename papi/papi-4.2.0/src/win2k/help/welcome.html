            <h3>Caveats:</h3>
     This release of PAPI for Windows contains the basic PAPI functionality. 
It works, but it is still a work in progress. Some fundamental  limitations 
exist. For example, this implementation measures  everything at the system 
level, not the process or thread level. Although PAPI properly binds itself 
to the processor on which it is called on a&nbsp; MultiProcessor Build of 
Windows, PAPI  will still measure all events on that processor at the system 
rather than process level. Further,  some advanced areas such as multiplexing, 
overflow, and profiling have not  been exhaustively tested and may not perform 
as advertised. We hope to remove  these restrictions in future releases. Check
            <a href="http://icl.cs.utk.edu/papi/">   the PAPI website</a>
      for information on current releases.<br>

            The WinPAPI Shell Application</h2>
             The Shell provides a simple interface to the basic functions 
of  PAPI   on  Windows. You can run the shell from the shortcut in the Start-&gt;Programs-&gt;WinPAPI 
      path, or by double-clicking the icon in the directory where WinPAPI 
was    installed. The Shell consists of a splash screen with eight buttons, 
as  described  below:<br>

            The PAPI Programmer's Reference</h2>
             The PAPI programming interface consists of a collection of 6 
high-level      calls, and roughly 40 low-level calls for both C and Fortran. 
Unix style     man pages for each of these calls are available in html format 
            <a href="html/papi.html">           here</a>
     .                                                                  
                                                                        
                 
                <h2><a name="examples"></a>
            The Example Suites</h2>
      Two sets of precompiled eamples are included with the WinPAPI Shell 
Application.   The first set is written in C and resides in the /tests directory. 
The second   similar set is written in Fortran and duplicates many of the 
C examples.  &nbsp;This set is in the /ftests directory. Both sets execute 
 as Windows  console applications, and can be run quietly in batch mode to 
provide go/no-go  testing of the PAPI installation, or from a command line 
to provide more detailed information.The examples provide a variety of measurements 
of  operations  and functionality on your system and print their results to
the console window.   If you run them from the Shell Application, they will
dynamically open in   a console window that is dismissed with a keystroke 
after the test completes.    You can also run the examples directly by opening 
a console window and typing   the name of the test as shown below for the 
C examples:

            Programming your own examples</h2>
      PAPI and the programs in the example suites were all developed using
 Microsoft   Visual Studio. The C compiler was Visual C++ 6.0, and the Fortran
 compiler   was Compaq Visual Fortran 6.6.0. If you want to modify any of
the existing   examples or use them as templates    to create your own programs,
 you must   have these or more recent tools installed on your computer. If
 you do, you   can click the shortcut  to PAPI_tests.dsw or PAPI_ftests.dsw
 found in the  Start-&gt;Programs-&gt;WinPAPI  path. These shortcuts will
open a workspace  in Visual Studio that contains projects for all the examples
 included with  this installation. You can then open the source for any example
 to examine  how things are done, or use any of the projects to pattern the
 development  of a test of your own. Note that the files in all the projects
  are referenced  by paths relative to the existing project. If you move
anything,   the builds  are likely to break.<br>
     In addition to the basic C and Fortran examples, several examples in 
both   languages are provided to demonstrate the Perfometer interface. You 
can open  the perfometer_tests.dsw project file to view and experiment with 
these examples.

            Typical <a href="results.html">Output</a>
             from some C Examples</h2>
             The programs included with the Example Suites are intended to
 illustrate   a variety of features of PAPI, or solutions to specific user
 problems. They     also serve as examples of programming with PAPI. The
best  way to understand     what the tests are doing is to browse the source
code  included in the "Typical"    installation. If you do not have Microsoft
Visual  Studio installed, any other   text editor will work. These source
files can  be found in: <br>
            %root%\src\tests  (where %root% is the root directory where WinPAPI 
   was  installed).             <br>

      You can instrument your code by linking it to perfometer.lib, and adding
   calls to perfometer() or mark_perfometer() as appropriate. Several examples
   are provided in both source and compiled forms to illustrate how this
is   done.       The source code for the Perfometer library and GUI is not
distributed    with this installation. The source code and project to rebuild
these components   is available in the <a href="#cvs">       PAPI CVS repository</a>
     .<br>
                  <br>
      The Perfometer GUI can be invoked through the <b>Perfometer </b>button
  in  the PAPI Shell Application or through the Start-&gt;Programs-&gt;WinPAPI-&gt;Perfometer
   shortcut. Either way produces a window similar to the one shown below:<br>
                  <br>
                  <img src="Perfometer.JPG" alt="Perfometer Screen" width="978" height="650">
                  <br>
                  <br>
      The area below the top button bar will initially be blank, indicating 
 that  the GUI is not connected to an executing program. You can use the 
           <b>  Connect  Local</b> or <b>Connect to Net</b> buttons to begin 
receiving data  from running  instrumented programs that are waiting for a
connection. The  color changes  in the bar chart indicate calls to mark_perfometer() 
with varying color paramters.  The other interface features of the Perfometer 
GUI are best discovered by  inspection and experimentation.<br>
                                                                        
                        
                <h2><a name="dll"></a>
            The WinPAPI Dynamic Link Library</h2>
                          The WinPAPI DLL consists of two pieces:       
                                                                        
                                                                        
   
                <ul>
                                                                        
                       <li> WinPAPI.DLL, installed (typically) in C:\WINNT\system32\,
      and</li>
                                                                        
                       <li> WinPAPI.lib, the linkable library, found in %root%\src\win2k\substrate\Release. 
      The library is placed in this arcane location to make sure that the 
test     projects can find it where they expect it to be in the development 
environment.     You can copy it to your own projects as desired.</li>
                                                                        
                        
                </ul>
             To incorporate PAPI calls into your codes, you must include
WinPAPI.lib      and papi.h, fpapi.h or papi_test.h in your project. You
can do this either   by referencing    the files in this directory tree,
or by copying the files   to your local  project.              <br>
            The source code for the PAPI library is not distributed with
this   installation.     If you would like access to the source code and
project   to rebuild the  library,  you must use the <a href="#cvs">    
  PAPI CVS   repository</a>
      .                                                                 
                                                                        
                  
                <h2><a name="kernel"></a>
            The WinPMC Kernel Driver</h2>
             The WinPMC Kernel Driver is a small (~3K) code that provides 
access    to  the normally restricted assembly instructions that allow programming
   of the  hardware performance monitoring counters found on all Pentium
class     x86 cpus.  If the driver has been installed successfully, the Driver 
Test     button in the WinPAPI Shell will be enabled and the tests it performs 
will    be successful.              <br>
            The driver file, WinPMC.sys, requires administrator privileges
 to  be  installed   in C:\WINNT\system32\drivers. Also, the registry must
 be modified  for this   service to be recognized by calling programs. DO
NOT attempt to  install this  driver on a new machine by simply copying the
file!             <br>
            As with the PAPI library, The source code for the Kernel Driver 
  is  not   distributed with this installation. The  source   code for the
  library is available in the <a href="#cvs">       PAPI CVS repository</a>
     . In addition to Microsoft Visual Studio, you must also have a current 
 version    of the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/ddk/">Microsoft NTDDK</a>
             installed on your computer to rebuild the driver.          
                                                                        
                                                                        
                <h2><a name="files"></a>
            The structure of PAPI files and folders on your disk</h2>
             The folder structure created on your disk to hold the PAPI installation 
     may appear rather arcane and complex. This is because it must reproduce 
   the  folder structure of the development environment in order for the test
   applications  to build successfully. The structure of the default install
   is shown graphically  below:<br>

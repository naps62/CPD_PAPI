Java Native Wrappers for PAPI
-----------------------------

This code is unfinished, untested, undocumented, and probably doesn't work.  

PapiJ.java contains the method declarations and mentions which PAPI
function wrappers are not implemented.

Papi.c contains the JNI wrappers.

To build, type "make" and if things go well, you should have the
shared library libpapij.so, which the Java code will attempt to load
at run time.  The compilation is known to succeed on Solaris 8 and
Red Hat 7.1, but hasn't been tried on others.

To try a simple example, see the README in the examples subdirectory.

\fBPAPI_write()\fP writes the counter values provided in the array values into the event set EventSet. The virtual counters managed by the PAPI library will be set to the values provided. If the event set is running, an attempt will be made to write the values to the running counters. This operation is not permitted by all substrates and may result in a run-time error.

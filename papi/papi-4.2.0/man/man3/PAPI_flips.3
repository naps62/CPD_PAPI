PAPI_flips \- 
.PP
Simplified call to get Mflips/s (floating point instruction rate), real and processor time.

\fBParameters:\fP
.RS 4
\fI*rtime\fP total realtime since the first \fBPAPI_flips()\fP call 
.br
\fI*ptime\fP total process time since the first \fBPAPI_flips()\fP call 
.br
\fI*flpins\fP total floating point instructions since the first call

.PP
\fBReturn values:\fP
.RS 4
\fIPAPI_EINVAL\fP The counters were already started by something other than: \fBPAPI_flips()\fP or \fBPAPI_flops()\fP. 
.br
\fIPAPI_ENOEVNT\fP The floating point operations, floating point instructions or total cycles event does not exist. 
.br
\fIPAPI_ENOMEM\fP Insufficient memory to complete the operation.
.RE
.PP
The first call to \fBPAPI_flips()\fP will initialize the PAPI High Level interface, set up the counters to monitor \fBPAPI_FP_INS\fP and \fBPAPI_TOT_CYC\fP events and start the counters. Subsequent calls will read the counters and return total real time, total process time, total floating point instructions since the start of the measurement and the Mflip/s rate since latest call to \fBPAPI_flips()\fP. A call to \fBPAPI_stop_counters()\fP will stop the counters from running and then calls such as \fBPAPI_start_counters()\fP can safely be used.
